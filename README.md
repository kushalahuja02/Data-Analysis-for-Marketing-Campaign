# Data Science Models for Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build data science models that provide valuable insights into two key business questions:
1. Identifying customer segments most responsive to marketing campaigns.
2. Deriving effective business strategies based on the insights gained.

To achieve these objectives, this project involves:
- Developing statistical learning models to predict the success of marketing campaigns for different customers.
- Extracting at least three key insights to aid in informed decision-making regarding marketing strategies.
- Presenting results from at least two different sets of predictions, employing both parametric and non-parametric models.
