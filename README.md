# Data Science Models for Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to build data science models that provide valuable insights into two key business questions:
1. Identifying customer segments most responsive to marketing campaigns.
2. Deriving effective business strategies based on the insights gained.

To achieve these objectives, this project involves:
- Developing statistical learning models to predict the success of marketing campaigns for different customers.
- Extracting at least three key insights to aid in informed decision-making regarding marketing strategies.
- Presenting results from at least two different sets of predictions, employing both parametric and non-parametric models.

## Models
### Parametric Model
- Logistic Regression served as our parametric cornerstone, chosen for its explanatory prowess with large datasets. It provided a reliable interpretive framework to assess the success variables of our marketing ventures, translating statistical coefficients into business vernacular.

### Non-Parametric Model
- Random Forest stood as the non-parametric sentinel, tackling the dataset's complexity with grace. Its capacity to integrate a mixture of categorical and numerical data without the need for scaling made it an indispensable tool for revealing the hidden layers of feature significance.
## Insights Gained
- Insight 1: The paramount influence of 'contact duration' on campaign results emerged, underscoring the need for meaningful customer engagement to boost subscription rates.
- Insight 2: Job titles held predictive power; particularly, roles in administration and management signaled higher propensity for subscription, painting a clear target for marketing initiatives.
- Insight 3: The educational landscape revealed a fertile ground for subscriptions, with university graduates leading the charge, followed by an untapped potential among high school graduates.
